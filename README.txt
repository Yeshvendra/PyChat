PROJECT DESCRIPTION
===================

The project is the final deliverable of course CSI-5180: Topics of AI (Virtual Assistant) at the University of Ottawa.
In this project we intend to create a Python coding question and answer chatbot called PyChat. The chatbot will take in
input as the python programming question and the corresponding output code will be displayed. To provide a good user
interface to our chatbot we created a HTML, CSS and JavaScript based web application.
